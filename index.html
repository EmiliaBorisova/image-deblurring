        <h2> Problem setup </h2>
        <div class="underline"></div>
        <p>
            The problem we are trying to solve is deblurring images, or making them sharper and more clear. We started with an image dataset of blurred images and then applied our deep learning models to try to bring the blurred images back to their original clarity.        
        </p>
        <p>
            Image deblurring is crucial to recover images that were taken hurriedly or without enough time to focus the camera, typically caused by shaky hands (or shaky camera) or taken while in motion. Blurry images can decrease the quality of the image and cover crucial details captured in the image. By using deep learning to clear images, it can bring more information to the image such as helping with facial recognition, text clarity, image detection, and many more things. Deblurring images are especially useful to law enforcement to help interpret blurry photo evidence, or even just to the average photographer to improve the quality and clarity of their photos that may have been taken in a rush.
        </p>
        <p>
            This problem of deblurring images has been less popular among deep learning research, but recently many research papers have been published that propose various methods for addressing the issue (Aittala & Durand, 2018; Albluwi et al., 2018; Rath, 2020). We used many of these papers for inspiration on constructing our own neural networks to solve this issue and produce the most optimal deblurring models that we could.

        <h2> Data used </h2>
        <div class="underline"></div>
        <p>
            To help remedy this issue, your department can host informative, discussion-based sessions that expose students to this learning related issue. The reason why a college environment would be best is because all the populations at-risk are present here – first-generation college students, women, and racial minorities. This is also true of an industry setting, however, college is usually the first place that students may begin to identify with Imposter Syndrome (Canning, LaCrosse, Kroeper, & Murphy, 2019). Having universities hold these workshops, then, would be a great way to target the issue as soon as it begins to manifest.
        </p>
        <p id="exception">
            The sessions can have three main components:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Faculty member acts as a discussion facilitator and begins by introducing the phenomenon and sharing their own experiences with it to demonstrate that imposter feelings could be present regardless of achievement.
            </li>
            <li>
                Facilitator poses reflective questions and has students share their own experiences with Imposter Syndrome to foster a feeling of togetherness without calling for too much vulnerability.
            </li>
            <li>
                Facilitator discusses coping strategies.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            While these sessions could be held at a university-wide level, it is best for each department to host them separately because it creates a more intimate environment when students feel familiar with the discussion leader and other attendees.

        <h2> Techniques </h2>
        <div class="underline"></div>
        <p>
            There are multiple research studies supporting this approach. For example, a study conducted by Haney, Birkholz, and Rutledge (2018) sampled students from various medical professions and had them complete a 1-day workshop on Imposter Syndrome led by a faculty member. After the event, students reported feeling empowered as a result of the workshop, one student felt confident enough to apply for a new position they had been thinking about, and another one found it less intimidating to submit a paper to a conference.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another research article supporting this solution was conducted by Baumann, Faulk, Vanderlan, Chen, and Bhayani (2020). Rather than doing a workshop, however, they had multiple 30–45-minute faculty-led small-group discussions on the topic of Imposter Syndrome. After each session, a survey was given to the students to assess the effectiveness of the event. It was found that 96% of the participants felt comfortable recognizing Imposter Syndrome in themselves and 81% felt that the session was successful in remedying their feelings (Baumann, Faulk, Vanderlan, Chen, & Bhayani, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
            The high value of both the qualitative and quantitative data recorded as a result of these studies demonstrates the strong impact of holding informative, reflective sessions on Imposter Syndrome. Students leave these events with a new perspective in mind and are better equipped to face this learning-related issue on their own.
