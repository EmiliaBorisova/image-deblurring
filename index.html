        <h2> Problem setup </h2>
        <div class="underline"></div>
        <p>
            The problem we are trying to solve is deblurring images, or making them sharper and more clear. We started with an image dataset of blurred images and then applied our deep learning models to try to bring the blurred images back to their original clarity.        
        </p>
        <p>
            Image deblurring is crucial to recover images that were taken hurriedly or without enough time to focus the camera, typically caused by shaky hands (or shaky camera) or taken while in motion. Blurry images can decrease the quality of the image and cover crucial details captured in the image. By using deep learning to clear images, it can bring more information to the image such as helping with facial recognition, text clarity, image detection, and many more things. Deblurring images are especially useful to law enforcement to help interpret blurry photo evidence, or even just to the average photographer to improve the quality and clarity of their photos that may have been taken in a rush.
        </p>
        <p>
            This problem of deblurring images has been less popular among deep learning research, but recently many research papers have been published that propose various methods for addressing the issue (Aittala & Durand, 2018; Albluwi et al., 2018; Rath, 2020). We used many of these papers for inspiration on constructing our own neural networks to solve this issue and produce the most optimal deblurring models that we could.

        <h2> Data used </h2>
        <div class="underline"></div>
        <p>
            The dataset we used was the ‘Blur Dataset’ from Kaggle (Alekseev, 2019). This dataset contains image triplets which have images in 3 different ways: defocused blurred, motion-blurred, and sharp images. As an additional comparison metric, we also generated images blurred using the Gaussian algorithm to have more blurry images that we can run our models on. After training our models, we compared the resulting image with the corresponding sharp image from the dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms.

        <h2> Process </h2>
        <div class="underline"></div>
        <p>
            Training: 
            We used a Google colab workspace for a lot of our model development and basic code testing, and we used a local Jupyter Lab notebook for our more intensive training. 
            The local server was set up by a team member with access to powerful hardware necessary for training. 
            The server was set up for remote access by all team members and featured the same collaborative workspace as the Google colab workspace. 
            The local server used more powerful hardware than that available to us on the Google colab workspace, did not time out after any period of inactivity, and never artificially limited our code runtime, making it the ideal choice for our training.
        </p>
        <p>
            Phase 1: Training on defocused blur, motion blur, and gaussian blurred images.        
        </p>
        <p>
            In the first phase, we weren’t sure which of blurred images our model would perform best on, so we experimented with training on all three types and comparing results.         
        </p>
        <p>
            Phase 2: Training on gaussian5, gaussian 10, and gaussian25        
        </p>
        <p>
            After concluding that gaussian-blurred images give the best results for our model, we then tried to experiment further with gaussian and train our models on different levels of gaussian and comparing results within those three.
